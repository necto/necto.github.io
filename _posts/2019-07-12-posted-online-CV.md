Writing CV is hard, but I finally got together and [composed one](/online-cv/), feel free to check it out and contact me, if you see how it can be even better.
Thank's to the [free template](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) from , it was educational, fun and addictive (that latter may be just my personality, though).

Oh boy, those publications take forever to garner all the assets and get links straight (7 links per paper(!)).

Now's time for the PDF version, as some people still like it oldschool.
